## Project Overview

This project is a real-time chat application that enables users to exchange messages. The chat is built on a client-server architecture using WebSocket for bidirectional communication, ensuring rapid data transmission without needing to reload the page.

The main goal of this project is to create a platform for messaging, suitable for both personal and business use.

## Key Features

- **Instant Messaging:** Users can send and receive messages in real-time without delays.
- **Multi-User Support:** The chat supports multiple users simultaneously.
- **Group and Private Chats:** Ability to create group chats or have private conversations between two users.
- **Media File Support:** Send images, videos, audio, and documents.
- **Message History:** Store message history on the server, allowing users to view past conversations at any time.
- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Secure login via email and password, as well as OAuth (e.g., Google or Facebook).

## Technical Requirements

- **Frontend:** React.js with state management libraries (Redux) and Socket.IO for server communication.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Fastify to handle requests and Socket.IO for WebSocket connections.
- **Database:** MongoDB to store user information, message history, and other data.
- **Hosting:** The project can be deployed on any platform that supports Node.js.

## Architecture

1. **Client Side (Frontend):**
   - Built with React.js integrated with Socket.IO to connect to the server.
   - Displays the user interface, including the user list, message list, input form for new messages, and other UI elements.
   - State management using Redux to support single-page applications (SPA).

2. **Server Side (Backend):**
   - Server developed using Node.js with Fastify for handling HTTP requests.
   - Socket.IO for managing real-time connections with clients.
   - MongoDB is used to store user information and message history.

3. **Database:**
   - MongoDB: A NoSQL database that efficiently stores and handles large amounts of data, such as chat messages, media files, and user data.
